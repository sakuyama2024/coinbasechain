## Current Phase Progress

### Phase 1: Protocol Foundation
```

Status: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started
Next Actions:
  1. Define protocol constants in protocol.hpp
  2. Implement message header structure
  3. Create serialization framework
```

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async I/O:** All network operations use Boost.Asio with callbacks/futures
- **Threading Model:** Single io_context thread initially, can expand to thread pool
- **Memory Management:** Use shared_ptr for Peer objects due to async lifetime
- **Error Handling:** Use error_code pattern, no exceptions in async paths

### Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern:** For peer state changes and message notifications
- **Strategy Pattern:** For different message handlers
- **Factory Pattern:** For creating message objects from wire data

### Technical Debt
- Track items that need refactoring here as we build
