## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Before Fixes Applied

All attack simulation tests in `test/security_attack_simulations.cpp` should **FAIL** or demonstrate vulnerabilities:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make coinbasechain_tests

# Run security attack simulations (EXPECTED TO FAIL before fixes)
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack]"
```

**Expected Results (BEFORE fixes):**
- Most tests will fail or timeout
- Node may crash on some attacks
- Memory exhaustion may occur
- CPU exhaustion may occur

---

### After Fixes Applied

Same attack simulation tests should **PASS** and demonstrate protection:

```bash
# Run security attack simulations (EXPECTED TO PASS after fixes)
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack]"
```

**Expected Results (AFTER fixes):**
- All attackers disconnected before damage occurs
- No memory exhaustion
- No CPU exhaustion
- All tests pass cleanly

---

### Test Organization

**Quick Tests (Phase 0):**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][quick]"
```

**P0 Critical Attack Tests:**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack][p0]"
```

**P1 High Priority Attack Tests:**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack][p1]"
```

**P2/P3 Attack Tests:**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack][p2]"
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack][p3]"
```

**Comprehensive Multi-Attack Test:**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][attack][comprehensive]"
```

**Performance Regression Test:**
```bash
./coinbasechain_tests "[security][performance]"
```
